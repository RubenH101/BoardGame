Introduction:
Hello, and thank you for playing “Final Game”. You are in a world filled with large rectangles where you are also a rectangle. Your task here is to shoot on the large square that is lurking around a grid type landscape. In your way, you will have pesky little green spring traps that automatically spring you so high in the sky that you die. There are also evil pink monsters that steal your ammo. Around the grid, you can find additional ammo to help you take down the dragon. And finally, you have to find the big red rectangles or the Dragon. Throughout your journey, you’ll receive messages indicating potential hazards. If you feel lucky enough, attempt to shoot. But if you miss three times, game over! Attempt to kill the Dragon, the challenge is yours!
